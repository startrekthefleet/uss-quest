The Quest uses Voyager-era uniforms. If you are into cosplaying, by all means, make your own uniform. However, we understand that not everyone has the sewing bug. Therefore, we recommend the following retailers:

## Uniform

Cosermart provides cheap, well-made [jackets](https://www.ebay.com/itm/325285183503?hash=item4bbc82000f%3Ag%3AzeQAAOSwJMpjLm2y&fbclid=IwY2xjawHj9WlleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdpD71VWHFRNubmbynC-0IXNOsjVCsl8uyLggQKJ12BAXh5qtPhMcZAhbw_aem_lqeCkah6iYoZAX0cEDFBvw) and [undershirts](https://www.ebay.com/itm/324758571388?var=513762929414).

## Commbadge

We recommend the licensed retailer [fansets](https://fansets.com/collections/magnets/products/copy-of-star-trek-voyager-ds9-delta-licensed-fansets-pin).
