# USS Quest

## About the ship

Our chapter is symbolized through the Olympic-class Starfleet vessel, the USS Quest, registry number NCC-50602. Of course if you ask any Quest member, they may just refer to her as “The Disco Ball."

The Olympic-class was launched in the early 2360s and it was designed specifically to serve in medical emergencies and crises throughout the Alpha Quadrant. Its sphere-shaped bow hull makes it unique among other Starfleet ship-classes of its era, and it takes influence from the 22nd Century-era Daedalus-class. 

It’s also unique among The Fleet, being the only ship of her class among all other chapters as of 2025.

On-screen, the Olympic-class is best known for being represented by the USS Pasteur - NCC-58925 - in the final episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, “All Good Things…”. She was captained by Beverly Crusher, MD in 2395. Though that particular appearance was in an aborted Alternate Timeline, the Olympic-class has also made canonical appearances as well.

In the 2370s, the USS Quito - registry unknown - was the ship Ensign Beckett Mariner was stationed prior to being reassigned to the USS Cerritos, as seen on Star Trek: Lower Decks, specifically in the episodes “Cupid’s Errant Arrow” (Season 1, Episode 5) and “Grounded” (S3, E1).

The design came from Bill George, then a VFX art director at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) - the studio that did the original special effects for Star Trek: The Next Generation - who was inspired by Matt Jeffries work on the Enterprise for Star Trek: The Original Series and in particular fixated on an earlier design for the Enterprise - one that later became retconned into canon as the Daedalus-class - that utilized a sphere-section instead of a saucer. 

On his own time, George built the model for what would become the Olympic-class and requested TNG's design team if his ship model could be used in an episode. They would end up using it for the USS Pasteur in the series finale. 

It's not confirmed, but it is likely that the class of ship got its name from the Olympic-class ocean liners built by the British company, White Star Line in the 1908. Until the RMS Queen Mary (now moored on the shores of our very own City of Long Beach) was commissioned in 1936, these were the largest transportation vessels ever built on Earth. Three ships were built of this line: 
* The first, the RMS Olympic, survived long enough to be formally decommissioned in 1935. When commandeered into military service during World War I, the Olympic became the only passenger liner to ram and sink a German submarine during that war.</li>  
* The last one built, the HMHS Britannic, was also commandeered into service during WWI, though this time as a hospital ship - much like the Pasteur in "All Good Things..." She was sadly sunk after hitting an explosive mine in 1916.</li>  
* The remaining of the three was also the most infamous - the RMS Titanic, which met a tragic fate on her maiden voyage in 1912 by hitting an ice berg and sinking shortly afterwords. The sinking of the Titanic led to many reforms in maritime safety. It also became the subject of many books, films, archeological studies and cultural shorthand.


Given that it was built solely as a labor of love by someone outside of the production, it is one of the few ship models in Star Trek’s history to have not been built or commissioned in-house.

### History

The USS Quest was launched by order of Fleet Admiral Philip Morganthaler in 2022. Her founding officers were Denise Cabral, Travis Baker, Deborah Khider and Sean Warren.

### Legacy

The Quest's namesake is derived from the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton in his final expedition to Antarctica.

Once a Norwegian seal-hunting ship called the Foca I, Shackleton attempted to convert her into a vessel fit for the frigid Antarctic seas. However, despite Sir Ernest’s modifications, the Quest quickly proved to be inadequate to complete the expedition, suffering much damage and requiring repair stops at every port. Sadly, her legacy is marked by Ernest Shackleton’s untimely death onboard during the expedition due to congenital heart failure at the young age of 47.

Needless to say, the Starship Quest does not share the signature qualities that marked her namesake and ill-fated voyage. For one, she is not a vessel of exploration, but of healthcare - outfitted to treat a variety of medical ailments, including the kind that took Shacklton’s life.

Second, “Quest” was the ship’s original name during her construction. Some aloof admiral thought it just sounded cool, not knowing the history of the name. While some might think this was bad luck, the inaugural crew of the Quest knew better than to change her name post-launch for that would bring more bad luck than just a dubious christening - a lesson Ernest Shackleton did not learn upon purchasing the Foca I. 

Lastly, the Quest is not nor ever was in the business of animal hunting or harm. In fact, there is a shipwide superstition that pets are good luck, so almost every crewmember has at least one pet animal - also known as “morale officers.” 

There are said to be hundreds of domesticated animals on the USS Quest… though only one of them is a turtle.

### Other Fun Facts

* Tribbles are allowed to be officer’s pets, provided that they are spayed and neutered prior to boarding the ship.
* As with every other medical facility, the Quest is said to be as haunted as our neighborship, the RMS Queen Mary. There have been reports of ghosts and other unexplained spectres haunting the warp nacelles. Most notably in Engineering, a crewmember in an outdated uniform can be seen wandering the Engineering areas. It is believed that this is the ghost of Will George, a crewman who disappeared without explanation many years ago. Of course no matter who it is - or was - since the crewmember is Starfleet, obviously they are harmless.
* Many Catian officers serve on the Quest - one of them is even a counselor. During a Code Grey medical emergency, these officers will hum in a frequency that helps calm down patients exhibiting belligerent and threatening behavior. Of course, a B52 hypospray also helps.</li>
*Unlike most Federation starships, a significant section of this vessel sometimes uses centrifugal force instead of artificial gravity nets to simulate gravity. That would be the sphere section at the Quest’s bow - also known to the crew as the “Disco Ball”. Much like the famous Sun Dial restaurant in Atlanta, GA, the interior decks of the “Disco Call” slowly spin horizontally when the Quest is moored at a starbase. Some have compared this to the rapidly spinning saucer function of the USS [REDACTED] when it would activate its [REDACTED]. However the reasoning for the Quest being designed this way is unknown. Nevertheless, the Captain often refers to this spinning phase as “party mode”.
