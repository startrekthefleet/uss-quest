The *Quest* primarily specializes in care for animals and the environment. Being based out of the "Aquatic Capital of the World, our crew participates in beach clean-ups, wetland restorations and walks through local nature preserves. We also donate to fundraisers meant to benefit animal shelters and adoption agencies for cats and dogs. 

Charities we support: 
- [Long Beach Animal Care Services](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=long+beach+animal+care+services&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) 
- [Los Cerritos Wetlands Authority's (LCWA)](https://intoloscerritoswetlands.org)
- [Helen Sanders Cat Protection and Welfare Society (CatPAWS)](https://helensanderscatpaws.com)
